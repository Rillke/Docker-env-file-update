# Update scripts for docker(-compose) env files [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Rillke/Docker-env-file-update.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Rillke/Docker-env-file-update)

Supplying environment variables through files is a convenient way to manage a larger number of configuration options applied through environment variables. Both, [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-environment-variables--e-env-env-file) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/env-file/) support reading environment variables from a file.

The update scripts are intended to be used during manual deployments and expect stdin being available for prompting for your input.

## Docker

> You can also load the environment variables from a file.
> This file should use the syntax `<variable>=value` (which
> sets the variable to the given value) or `<variable>`
> (which takes the value from the local environment),
> and `#` for comments.

Note: Only the `<variable>=value` syntax, blank lines and comments are supported by this collection of scripts (i.e. not `<variable>`). Please feel free submitting merge requests to overcome this shortcoming.

## Docker-compose

> Compose supports declaring default environment variables
> in an environment file named `.env` placed in the folder
> where the `docker-compose` command is executed (*current
> working directory*).

> These syntax rules apply to the .env file:
>
> - Compose expects each line in an `env` file to be in `VAR=VAL` format.
> - Lines beginning with `#` (i.e. comments) are ignored.
> - Blank lines are ignored.
> - There is no special handling of quotation marks (i.e. **they will be part of the VAL**, you have been warned ;) ).

## Contents

- Limitations:
    - Install script will attempt attaching post-checkout hook to /dev/tty (Keyboard). This might break automated deployments. Do not use the script installer if your terminal is incompatible or if no keyboard device exists.
    - Might not handle literal `\n` in comments correctly. Please submit merge requests.
- Requirements: Bash version 4 support or higher

### update-env.sh

- Updates an existing `.env` file with missing variables from a template file by prompting for their value (offering a default from the template).
- Tracks who made the additions and when the additions were made.
- Prints possibly unused/obsolete variables to stdout.

### prettify-env.sh

- Re-creates an existing `.env` file using a templates fills missing variables by prompting for their value (offering a default from the template)
- Adds possibly unused/obsolete variables in a bottom section.
- Because the whole file is rewritten each time, the template structure is restored. With `diff .env.example .env` changes to the default values from the template are easily spotted.

## Git: Self-update when checking out another version

### Using an installation script
```sh
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rillke/Docker-env-file-update/master/install.sh | bash
```

### Step by step

Git provides so-called hooks. The `post-checkout` hook script is executed by Git after a new version is checked out (e.g. after a `git pull` or a `git checkout hash/tag/version`). This allows for keeping your `.env` file automatically up-to-date. Note that hooks are a local concept and do not become part of the repository, so install them in each clone of your repo you need them on.

Example:

0. Assuming that your template file's name is `.env.example` and your env file's name is `.env`.
1. In your repository create a `.git/hooks/post-checkout` file with the follwing contents:

```sh
#!/bin/sh
#
# After you run a successful git checkout, the post-checkout hook runs;
# you can use it to set up your working directory properly for your
# project environment. This may mean moving in large binary files that
# you donâ€™t want source controlled, auto-generating documentation, or
# something along those lines.

if [ -f prettify-env.sh ]; then
  bash prettify-env.sh .env.example .env
else
  echo "prettify-env.sh not found. Your .env file won't be updated."
fi
```

2. Put a copy of `prettify-env.sh` into your repository (example is for the working directory but it should also work in the hidden `.git` directory if you adjust the paths in `.git/hooks/post-checkout` accordingly).
3. Test, however note that `prettify-env.sh` will remove all customized comments from `.env`. If you do not wish this behaviour, use `update-env.sh` instead. For instance, try `git checkout master`

### Uninstallation

Remove the line invoking the script from `post-checkout`, or if this is the only command invoked, delete the `post-checkout` file entirely. By default, you can find the `post-checkout` hook file under `.git/hooks`. If the file does not exist, run the installation script again (abort it with `Ctrl`+`C` if necessary) and it will tell you where your `post-checkout` hook file is located.

## Snippets

### Convert Docker `.env` file to bash-compatible `.env` file format

```sh
# Load environment
eval $( cat .env | grep -v ^# | sed -r 's/(["\\])/\\\1/g' | sed -rn 's/(.+?)\=(.+)/\1="\2"/p' )
# Store into file
cat .env | grep -v ^# | sed -r 's/(["\\])/\\\1/g' | sed -rn 's/(.+?)\=(.+)/\1="\2"/p' > .bash.env
```

1. Read `.env` file
2. Strip comments
3. Escape double quotes (`"`) and backslashes (`\`)
4. Enclose values in double quotes
